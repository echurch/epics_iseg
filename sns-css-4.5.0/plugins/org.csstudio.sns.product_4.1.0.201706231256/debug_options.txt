# Debug options
#
# This file, renamed to ".options" and placed in the CSS installation directory,
# is used when the "-debug" option is supplied to css.
# When placed elsewhere under a different name, it can be used
# via "-debug /full/path/to/the/file".
#
# During development, the same is effected from the "Run Configuration"
# "Tracing" tab: Enable tracing, then locate the following options in the GUI.

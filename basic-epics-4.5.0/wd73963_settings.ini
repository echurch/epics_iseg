# CSS Preference Settings.
#
# This file provides a common place to define or override preference settings
# for all Eclipse and CSS plugins.
#
# Specifically, it contains values for the SNS Office and ICS network
# which can be selected by commenting or un-commenting the respective
# sections.
#
# Fundamentally, the Eclipse preference mechanism works like this
# to allow customization at various levels:
# 1. Each plugin might contain default settings that are hardcoded
#    inside the Java sources of the plugin.
# 2. In addition, each plugin might have a file preferences.ini
#    in the root directory of the plugin directory or jar file.
#    When present, those values override the hardcoded settings.
#    Ideally, each plugin with preference settings has such a 
#    preferences.ini file to define the defaults because this
#    provides a convenient place to locate all the available
#    settings of a plugin in one file.
# 3. A plugin_customization.ini file like this one, located
#    in the root of the "Product" plugin directory or jar file
#    can override all of the above.
#    It is ideally used to provide site-specific defaults
#    (as this one does for using CSS at the SNS).
# 4. When starting CSS (or any Eclipse product), a customization file
#    with the same format can be provided via the -pluginCustomization
#    command line option.
#    This might be most useful for tests or special cases, because
#    generally it is more useful to update the site-specific settings
#    by editing the site-specific plugin_customization.ini file (step 3)
# 5. Finally, each end user can use the CSS/Preferences menu item to
#    interactively adjust most settings. Those changes are stored in the
#    workspace directory under 
#        {Workspace}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings
